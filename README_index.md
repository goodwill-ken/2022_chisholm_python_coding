W_1_Question_5:                                    Show the area of a rectangle to two decimal places

W_1_Question_6:                                    Calculate the area of a rectangle given user inputs for length and width
                                                  Declare the type of input if prompt is a string
                                                  
W_2_Question_1:                                    The company Chisholm Gadgets sell headphones for $20.
                                                  If you order over 500 of the headphones you get a 10% discount
                                                  Write a program using an if statement that calculates the cost
                                                  of an order of 600 headphones and  displays the cost.
                                                  use if else function.
                                                  
W_2_Question_1_extended:                           Same as W_2_Question_1 but now with inputs rather than 600.

W_2_Question_2:                                    Write a program that sets a number to 14
                                                  The program then displays whether the number is odd or even.
                                                  
W_2_Question_2_extended:                           The program displays whether any whole number is odd or even.

W_2_Question_3_extended:                           Write a program that uses a nested if to calculate the shipping cost
                                                  for Chisholm Gadgets. They only ship their headphones within Australia 
                                                  (AU) or the USA (US). For US if the order is $100 or less then the 
                                                  shipping cost is $50 but if it is over $100 then it is $25. Within AU 
                                                  if the order is $100 or less then the shipping cost is $10 and if it is 
                                                  over $100 then it is free shipping.
                                                  
W_2_Question_3_extended_more:                      Same as W_2_Question_3_extended but with additional capabilities added (ul):
                                                  Added greeting with user's name input, added time delays to the outputs, 
                                                  added bulk order discount of 10% for orders of over 600 units.
                                                  
W_2_Question_4:                                    Write a program that will prompt the user to enter an integer. If the number
                                                  is greater than 10 the program will display “The number entered is larger than
                                                  10” otherwise the program will display “The number entered in not larger than 10”
                                                  
W_2_Extended_skills_Pythagoras:                    Calculate the angle of a triangle given user inputs for Base, Altitude 
                                                  and Hypotenuse: a^2+b^2=c^2
                                                  Declare the type of input if prompt is a string
                                                 
W_3_Question_1:                                    At the Chisholm Carnival there is a ride that only allows children on

                                                  logical operator, which decides whether a child is allowed on or is

                                                    and then calculate and displays the area and circumference of the circle 
                                                    (A=πr^2 and C=2πr ) using pseudocode and a flowchart.

W_3_Question_5:                                    Write the algorithm for a program that sets the weight of a parcel to 12g. 
                                                    If the weight is 8 g or less, there is delivery charge of a flat fee of $1.50. 
                                                    If the weight is more than 8 g then $1.50 plus $0.50 for each gram over 8g is 
                                                    charged for delivery. The program displays the weight and the delivery fee.

                                                  and then displays the list.

W_4_Question_2:                                   Write a program that reverses the order of the list of pets 
                                                  (from question 1) and then displays the list.

                                                  word “Programming” in a different variable. The program displays the first letter 
                                                  of the first word (“P”), the last letter of the first word (“n”), the four letters 
                                                  in between of the first word (“ytho”) and the second word missing the first two letters.
                                                  (“ogramming”)

                                                  letter of the word, “d”, and places it at the end of the word.

                                                  The program will display the sentence all in upper case with no extra spaces at the start 
                                                  or end of the sentence.
                                                  
W_5_Questions_6:                                  Using the sentence from Question 5 - “I am learning to code in Python” write a program 
                                                  that splits the string into its seven individual words.
