# Write a program that stores the first word “Python” in a variable
# and the second word “Programming” in a different variable. The
# program displays the first letter of the first word (“P”), the
# last letter of the first word (“n”), the four letters in between
# of the first word (“ytho”) and the second word missing the first
# two letters (“ogramming”).
