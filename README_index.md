W_2_Question_1                                    The company Chisholm Gadgets sell headphones for $20.
                                                  If you order over 500 of the headphones you get a 10% discount
                                                  Write a program using an if statement that calculates the cost
                                                  of an order of 600 headphones and  displays the cost.
                                                  use if else function.
                                                  
W_2_Question_1_extended                           Same as W_2_Question_1 but now with inputs rather than 600.

W_2_Question_2                                    Write a program that sets a number to 14
                                                  The program then displays whether the number is odd or even.
                                                  
W_2_Question_2_extended                           The program displays whether any whole number is odd or even.

W_2_Question_3_extended                           Write a program that uses a nested if to calculate the shipping cost
                                                  for Chisholm Gadgets. They only ship their headphones within Australia 
                                                  (AU) or the USA (US). For US if the order is $100 or less then the 
                                                  shipping cost is $50 but if it is over $100 then it is $25. Within AU 
                                                  if the order is $100 or less then the shipping cost is $10 and if it is 
                                                  over $100 then it is free shipping.
                                                  
W_2_Question_3_extended_more                      Same as W_2_Question_3_extended but with additional capabilities added (ul):
                                                  Added greeting with user's name input, added time delays to the outputs, 
                                                  added bulk order discount of 10% for orders of over 600 units.
                                                  
W_2_Question_4                                    Write a program that will prompt the user to enter an integer. If the number
                                                  is greater than 10 the program will display “The number entered is larger than
                                                  10” otherwise the program will display “The number entered in not larger than 10”
                                                  
W_2_Extended_skills_Pythagoras                    Calculate the angle of a triangle given user inputs for Base, Altitude 
                                                  and Hypotenuse: a^2+b^2=c^2
                                                  Declare the type of input if prompt is a string
